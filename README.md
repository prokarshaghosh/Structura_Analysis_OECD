STAN Database for Structural Analysis

STAN database for structural analysis provides analysts and researchers with a comprehensive tool for analysing industrial performance at a relatively detailed level of activity across countries. It includes annual measures of output, value added and its components, labour input, investment and capital stock thus allowing to construct indicators which focus on productivity growth, competitiveness and general structural change.

STAN is primarily based on Member countries' Annual National Accounts by economic activity tables compiled according to the recommendations of System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008). Previous versions of STAN (from 2000) were based on SNA93 statistics. Missing data are estimated using other sources such as national industrial surveys/censuses. Time series are extended back to the 1970's where possible. This is done using vintage SNA93 or STAN estimates. In STAN, many data points are Secretariat's estimates and are flagged to the attention of users; as such, they do not represent official Member countries' submissions.

The current version of STAN is using an industry list based on the International Standard Industrial Classification of all economic activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev. 4). Earlier versions of STAN were based on ISIC Rev. 3 and, prior to 2000, ISIC Rev. 2 (the latter covering the manufacturing industries only).The industries covered in STAN provide sufficient detail to highlight technology and digital-intensive sectors.
